# CNB_Bot
This bot is designed to make coding (or any other activity) more fun,<br>
by using standard game mechanics, such as ranks, player levels, and achivements, to spice up your journey.<br>
You can create Issues, that anyone can pick up and solve for certain amount of points.<br>
It also helps you to keep track of your and others work by encouraging everyone to make daily log entries,<br>
and enabling you to see what your co-workers are working on.<br>
